                    <li>Each player opens the application on their own device. A random Mystery Card will be assigned to you, which your opponent will have to guess.</li>
                    <li>Then, each player asks their opponent a “yes or no” question, such as “is your person a man?” or “does your person wear glasses?”, and the answer gets them closer to who's on their opponent's Mystery Card. Click on the cards that don't fit the criteria to fade them out, until there's only 1 person left. A correct guess makes that player the winner. If they guess incorrectly, that player loses the chance to ask questions and the game continues until one of the players guesses right or has only one card left.</li>
                    <li>Refresh the browser to restart the game.</li>
